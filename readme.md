scrape_real_imp.py is run for create storage for scrape and will scrape picture as TARGET_TOTAL on topic and specific site in queries(can also just add topic no need to always add specific site).(still have like 0.66% picture that not real life  picture ex. infographic or something like that)
and the make_7_day_pic.py is random pic DAYS * IMAGES_PER_DAY to store in 1 folder and DAYS subfolders it also contain log for picture that already use so if you run later it will not get the picture that already use.
